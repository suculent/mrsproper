# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-10)

**Core value:** A group admin can confidently remove the right person from every relevant community in one safe, verified, rate-limit-respecting pass.

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack (research): Electron + GramJS in-process in main; UI in renderer over locked-down IPC; session encrypted via `safeStorage` (Keychain/DPAPI)
- Build order (research): auth/session -> rate-limit governor -> target resolution / group enumeration -> AuditStore + executor -> UI -> signing
- Phase 1: Embedded shared api_id treated as public; remote kill-switch / rotation is a v2 resilience concern (CRED-01), not a v1 blocker

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 4 (group rights) and Phase 5 (removal semantics) are MEDIUM-confidence — exact GramJS `Api.*` mapping for per-chat-type rights and the `deleteChatUser` vs `editBanned`/restrict-then-unban dispatch need verification; consider `/gsd:plan-phase --research-phase 4` and `--research-phase 5`
- Exact Telegram rate limits are unpublished by design — design the governor for adaptivity (dynamic FLOOD_WAIT parse + jitter + volume caps), validate pacing empirically against throwaway accounts in Phase 5
- Re-verify Electron stable + GramJS `telegram` minor versions before locking Phase 1 plans
